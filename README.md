# TimelineTools

## General

This is a web page for displaying the order of comics in the Uncanny X-Men series including some tie-ins and spin-offs, mostly ones from collections.

## Developer notes

There's no build/compile step and no development packages are needed.

Optionally you can run `yarn install` to install ESLint and related plugins to help with development.
