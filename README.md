## Developer notes:

Get set up by running `yarn install`. If you don't have `yarn`, install that.

We use webpack to bundle our files.
During development there are some useful scripts to use depending on the level of automation you prefer.

- `yarn run watch` will ensure that the webpack bundle automatically updates to reflect your code changes.
- `yarn start` will go a step further and automatically open the page in your browser.
- `yarn build` will build a production-ready bundle.js file.
